            <p>In 2021, I graduated from Central High School with an A+ Scholarship and Honor Society Cords. During my time there, I was deeply involved in music, playing in the Marching and Concert bands for four years and exploring Jazz for three.
              Alongside my musical pursuits, I developed my graphic design skills over four years, working with Adobe and Illustrator. I contributed to various projects, creating designs for businesses, local politicians, and individuals, ranging from t-shirts and hoodies to car decals and political yard signs.
